# Andhra Pradesh Open Data

An attempt to create a standardised open-data of names &amp; ids for Districts, Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies, AC Numbers


### Why?

There are 26 Districts, 175 Assembly Constituencies, 25 Parliament Constituencies, ~696 Mandals and 13000+ Villages in Andhra Pradesh. Often Media, Officals, Spokepersons, Politicians and general public tend to use Alternative spellings or names for the region. When building public portals for citizens it's becoming a difficult task to match the various datasets with alternative spellings. For example:

There are two "Gannavaram" Constituencies in Andhra Pradesh, one in Krishna District and another is in Kakinada District. Gannavaram in Krishna is a unreserved and Gannavarm in "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Konaseema" District is SC Reserved Constituency. Similarly two Prathipadu constituencies in Guntur and Kakinada Districts. 

There are Kovvur and Kovuru constituencies in "East Godavari" and "Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore" districts respectively and these names are bing used interchangeably when refering and alternative spellings like Kovvur, Kovuru etc are being used. Just like in the case of Anantapur/Ananthapur/Ananthapuramu or Konaseema/Dr B R Ambedkar Konaseema or Sri Sathya Sai/Sri Satya Sai or Nellore/SPS Nellore/Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore or Vishakapatnam/Vishakhapatnam for Visakhapatnam. There are numerous examples like these across datasets and also official usage. 

I have tried mostly to adopt the usage of location's "name" from official gazatte of Andhra Pradesh and ECI Data to prepare this dataset. And identifiers like "district_id", "constituency_id" and "loksabha_constituency_id" have been created by using "lowercase_and_spaces_replaced_with_underscore" logic and whenever there is a unique name, suffixed it's parent_location like district.
