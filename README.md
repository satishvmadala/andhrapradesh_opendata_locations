# Andhra Pradesh Open Data

## Overview
This micro-project aims to create a standardized open dataset of geographical names and identifiers for districts, assembly constituencies, parliamentary constituencies, mandals, and villages in Andhra Pradesh. The necessity for this arises from the frequent inconsistencies in name spellings and designations used across different platforms by media, officials, spokespersons, politicians, and the general public.



## Why?

There are 26 Districts, 175 Assembly Constituencies, 25 Parliament Constituencies, ~696 Mandals and 13000+ Villages in Andhra Pradesh. Often Media, Officals, Spokepersons, Politicians and general public tend to use Alternative spellings or names for the region. When building public portals for citizens it's becoming a difficult task to match the various datasets with alternative spellings. For example:

There are two "Gannavaram" Constituencies in Andhra Pradesh, one in Krishna District and another is in Kakinada District. Gannavaram in Krishna is a unreserved and Gannavarm in "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Konaseema" District is SC Reserved Constituency. Similarly two Prathipadu constituencies in Guntur and Kakinada Districts. 

There are Kovvur and Kovuru constituencies in "East Godavari" and "Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore" districts respectively and these names are bing used interchangeably when refering and alternative spellings like Kovvur, Kovuru etc are being used. Just like in the case of Anantapur/Ananthapur/Ananthapuramu or Konaseema/Dr B R Ambedkar Konaseema or Sri Sathya Sai/Sri Satya Sai or Nellore/SPS Nellore/Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore or Vishakapatnam/Vishakhapatnam for Visakhapatnam. There are numerous examples like these across datasets and also official usage. 
 

## Acknowledgements
This dataset compiles information sourced from the official gazette of Andhra Pradesh and the Election Commission of India, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

And identifiers like "district_id", "constituency_id" and "loksabha_constituency_id" have been created by using "lowercase_and_spaces_replaced_with_underscore" logic and whenever there is a unique name, suffixed it's parent_location like district.
